    "We target a range of characteristics including distributions in working hours and wages, the 30 years interest rate $(R_t)$, and the endogenous choice of pension + social security taxes $\\tau_t$. On top of this, we want to replicate the endogenous choice of system characteristics ($\\kappa_t$) that determines the share of pensions that are \"universal\". The distribution of wages and working hours can be in a very simple way by adjusting $\\eta_i, X_i$. This calibration can be done outside the numerical simulation of the model *given* the labor elasticity $\\xi$. \n",

    "The second set of targets $\\tau_t, R_t$ can be identified by adjusting the political weight of retirees $\\omega$ and the discount factor $\\beta$; This identification, however, is only done by simulating model solutions until the targets are reached. Thus, this is a somewhat costly calibration. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the choice of $\\kappa_t$ is numerically very challenging to identify. We essentially have two parameters that can help us identify the choice of the design of the system: The CRRA preference $\\rho$ and the labor elasticity $\\xi$. As we can see in the following, there is a small subset of the parameter space for $(\\xi, \\rho)$ that permits an interior solution. To get at this, we start by solving the model on a grid of both $(\\rho, \\xi)$: For each gridpoint, we define the \"objective\" as the difference between the target policy design $\\overline{\\kappa}$ and the endogenous choice $\\kappa_t$. What we need from the initial gridsearch is at least one level of $\\rho_n$ (or $\\xi$) where the objective on the grid of $\\xi$ (or $\\rho$) the objective value changes sign: A sign change allows us to apply a golden-section like search for a solution value of $\\xi$ (given $\\rho$). We can then proceed in a number of ways, depending on how much of the solution space (for $\\xi, \\rho$) we are interested in:\n",
    "* We can simply use the part of the solution space on the initial grid of $(\\rho, \\xi)$, where we observe a sign change.\n",
    "* We can start with the solution space on the initial grid, where we observe a sign change. Next, we can take the first and last value of $\\rho$, where we found a sign change on the grid of $\\xi$. Then, we can form a new grid between points where we *did* find a sign change and the nearest gridpoint where we did not. "
