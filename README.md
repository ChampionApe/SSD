# SSD
Code repository for Social Security Design and Its Political Design (2024)

## Basic Installation Guide
The yaml file ```setupVirtualEnv.yml``` sets up a virtual environment and install relevant packages in the specific verisons that I've used when running tests. The notebook ```Documentation.ipynb``` includes a description of the main classes and some examples on syntax.

### For people that are new to Python:
Install Anaconda distribution of Python. Install Github Desktop.
* Under the ```Code``` tab click ```Open with Github Desktop``` to clone the repository.
* Open "Anaconda Prompt" ("Terminal" for Mac users) and navigate to the folder where you've cloned the repo using the ```cd``` command.
* Install virtual environment writing: ```conda env create -f setupVirtualEnv.yml```.

**Opening/running notebooks**
The steps above install what is called a virtual environment on your computer called ```SSD```. To work in this environment, open Anaconda Prompt (or Terminal for Mac) and add ```conda activate SSD```.
